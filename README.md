# Hugo Docker Image

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a fast and flexible static site generator, written in Go. 
Hugo flexibly works with many formats and is ideal for blogs, docs, portfolios and much more. 
Hugoâ€™s speed fosters creativity and makes building a website fun again.

This Lightweight Docker Image is based on Alpine, and comes with rsync for Continuous Deployment.

## Running

To print Hugo Help:

```bash
docker run --rm -it jguyomard/hugo-builder hugo help
```

To create a new Hugo managed website:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src jguyomard/hugo-builder hugo new site mysite
cd mysite
```

To build your site:
 
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src jguyomard/hugo-builder hugo 
```

To serve your site locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -p 1313:1313 jguyomard/hugo-builder hugo server -w --bind=0.0.0.0 
```

Then open [`http://localhost:1313/`](http://localhost:1313/) in your browser.

## Bash Alias

For ease of use, you can create a bash alias:

```bash
alias hugo='docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src jguyomard/hugo-builder hugo'
alias hugo-server='docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/src -p 1313:1313 jguyomard/hugo-builder hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0'
```

Now, you can use `hugo help`, `hugo new foo/bar.md`, `hugo-server -w`, etc.
